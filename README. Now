# PROJECT NAME

## Objective
The Detection Lab project was designed to establish a powerful controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. We focused on ingesting and analyzing logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry that accurately replicates real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience significantly enhanced our understanding of network security, attack patterns, and effective defensive strategies.

### Skills Developed
- Mastered advanced SIEM concepts with practical applications that can be implemented immediately.
- Gained proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs to draw insightful conclusions.
- Acquired the ability to generate and identify attack signatures and patterns with confidence.
- Expanded knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities, positioning ourselves as informed cybersecurity experts.
- Cultivated critical thinking and problem-solving skills essential for tackling cybersecurity challenges.

### Tools Utilized
- Leveraged a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for efficient log ingestion and analysis.
- Used network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) to effectively capture and examine network traffic.
- Employed telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and simulate attack scenarios.
